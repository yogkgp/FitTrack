# Mobile App Release Guide

This guide explains how to prepare your app for production using **GitHub Actions (Android)** and **EAS (iOS)**.

---

## Part 1: Android (GitHub Actions)

You do **NOT** need to build manually. GitHub will do it for you.
However, you **MUST** do this one-time setup so GitHub has permission to sign your app.

### Step 1: Generate Release Key (One Time)

Run this command on your computer to create your private signature file.

- **Password**: Remember the password you choose!
- **Storage**: Keep the `.keystore` file safe.

```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore android/app/my-release-key.keystore -alias my-key-alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

### Step 2: Configure Secrets in GitHub

GitHub needs your key and passwords to sign the app.

1.  Go to your GitHub Repo -> **Settings** -> **Secrets and variables** -> **Actions**.
2.  Add these 4 secrets:

| Secret Name              | Value                                    |
| :----------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| `RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS`      | `my-key-alias` (or whatever you chose)   |
| `RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD`   | The password you typed in Step 1         |
| `RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD` | The password you typed in Step 1         |
| `KEYSTORE_BASE64`        | Run the command below to get this value: |

**Command to get KEYSTORE_BASE64 string:**

- **Mac/Linux**:
  ```bash
  base64 -i android/app/my-release-key.keystore | pbcopy
  ```
  (The long string is now in your clipboard. Paste it into GitHub).

### Step 3: Trigger the Build

1.  Check in your code (`git push`).
2.  Create a **Release** in GitHub (tag starting with `v`, e.g., `v1.0.0`) OR just push if your workflow is set to run on push.
3.  GitHub Actions will build the APK/AAB and attach it to the Release.

## Part 2: iOS (EAS Build)

We use Expo's cloud service (EAS) to build for iOS because it handles Apple Certificates automatically.

### Step 1: Install EAS CLI

```bash
npm install -g eas-cli
eas login
```

### Step 2: Build for App Store

Run this command. It will ask for your Apple ID credentials the first time.

```bash
eas build --platform ios --profile production
```

- **Result**: It will give you a link to download the `.ipa` file or automatically upload it to "App Store Connect" (if configured).

### Step 3: Upload to App Store

If the build didn't auto-submit:

```bash
eas submit -p ios
```

## Part 3: Install on iPhone (Offline / 7-Days)

By default, `npx expo run:ios` builds a **Debug** version that needs your Mac to be running (Metro Server). If you walk away from your Mac, the app will crash.

**To install a Standalone version (Works Offline/Away from Mac):**
Run this command:

```bash
npx expo run:ios --configuration Release --device
```

- **Benefits**: Runs offline. Faster performance.
- **Limitation**: Valid for 7 days (Free Developer Account) or 1 year (Paid Account).

## Appendix: Manual Gradle Config (Reference)

_This is already set up in your code, but here for reference in case files get reset._

**android/gradle.properties**:

```properties
MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_FILE=my-release-key.keystore
MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS=my-key-alias
MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD=my-secret-password
MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD=my-secret-password
```

**android/app/build.gradle**:
Uses the variables above to sign the release.
