/**
 * Energy density of body-weight change, in kcal per kg. Applies in **both**
 * directions -- weight lost and weight gained.
 *
 * Any "kcal per kg" figure is a blend of two fixed constants from Hall's model
 * (NIDDK Body Weight Planner): fat tissue ~9441 kcal/kg (39.5 MJ/kg) and lean
 * tissue ~1816 kcal/kg (7.6 MJ/kg). Picking a value is therefore just asserting
 * a fat:lean composition for the weight that changed. 6000 implies roughly
 * 55% fat / 45% lean and water.
 *
 * Lower than the textbook 7700 (which assumes 78/22, i.e. the "3500 kcal per
 * pound" rule) because over the short windows this app measures, a meaningful
 * share of the change is glycogen and water. Measured energy density of
 * short-term 1-3 kg swings averages ~2380 kcal/kg, i.e. below both figures.
 *
 * A direction-specific pair was evaluated and deliberately rejected: at the
 * lean-gain rates this app recommends (0.1-0.5% body weight/week), the gain
 * lands near the same ~55/45 blend, which works out to
 * 0.55 * 9441 + 0.45 * 1816 = ~6010 kcal/kg -- the same 6000 within the
 * precision anything here is measured to. A second constant would have implied
 * a distinction the data does not support.
 *
 * This is a modelling constant, not a user preference: it is unobservable to the
 * user (it needs a DEXA scan to know), and a wrong value silently skews every
 * calorie target with no visible symptom. It is deliberately not configurable.
