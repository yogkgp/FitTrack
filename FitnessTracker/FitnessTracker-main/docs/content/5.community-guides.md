# Community Guides

This section highlights community-contributed guides and resources for SparkyFitness. These guides are created by users like you to share knowledge, tips, and best practices.

## How to Contribute or Find Guides

If you have a guide you'd like to share, or if you're looking for specific community-driven content, here's how you can engage:

*   **Share your knowledge**: Write a guide and share it with the community. You can submit it as a pull request to the documentation repository.
*   **Join our Discord**: Engage with other community members, ask questions, and find answers in our Discord server. Many community guides and tips are shared there informally.
*   **GitHub Discussions**: Check the GitHub Discussions for ongoing conversations, shared solutions, and requests for new guides.
*   **Contribute to the documentation**: If you see a gap in the documentation or have a guide that would benefit others, consider contributing directly to this documentation site.

## Community Integrations

Standalone tools built by the community that work alongside SparkyFitness. They are **not** part of SparkyFitness, are not maintained by this project, and are not covered by its support — run them at your own discretion. Listing a tool here is not an official endorsement by SparkyFitness.

### Cronometer

[`cronometer-core`](https://github.com/johnkattenhorn/cronometer-core) — a read-only Cronometer client (Python CLI plus an MCP server) that pulls your own daily nutrition totals and biometrics from [cronometer.com](https://cronometer.com).

Run it on a schedule alongside SparkyFitness if you want your Cronometer history available outside the Cronometer app. It uses your ordinary cronometer.com login rather than an API key, because Cronometer publishes no public API — so it depends on an unofficial path that Cronometer may change or block at any time. It is deliberately kept as an independent script rather than a built-in provider ([#2159](https://github.com/CodeWithCJ/SparkyFitness/issues/2159)).

One limitation worth knowing before you try it, observed on a free-tier account: the `servings` export lists per-food rows (`Day,Time,Group,Food Name,Amount,Category`) with no nutrient columns, while only the `dailySummary` export carries the numbers, one row per day. On that path it is a daily-totals source, not a food-diary import. Paid tiers were not tested.
