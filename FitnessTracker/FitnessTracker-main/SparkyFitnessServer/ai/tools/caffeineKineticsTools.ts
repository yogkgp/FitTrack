// the kind of thing models get wrong, which is what produced the wrong
// times reported back to the user). Replace every instant with the same
// local date/time the web UI already renders via toLocaleTimeString().
//
// The lookback window is 48h (up to 2 calendar days before the requested
// date — see getActiveCaffeineKinetics), specifically so a dose from late
// yesterday that is still circulating counts toward "active now". A time
// alone reads as "today" by default, so a dose from yesterday evening
// looked like it was logged this morning; each dose carries its own local
// `date` precisely so a multi-day list can be read unambiguously.

        "Estimates the user's active caffeine right now and at their target bedtime, from their logged caffeine intake plus their personal half-life and target-bedtime preferences (caffeine_half_life_hours, target_bedtime). Also reports the latest time a dose of a given size could still be taken and clear by bedtime. Defaults to today. Read-only. Every date/time in the result (doses[].date/time, latest_safe_dose_time, target_bedtime) is already in the user's local timezone — use them exactly as given, do not attempt to convert or recompute one yourself. doses can include entries from up to 2 days before the requested date (still-active caffeine from earlier carries into the estimate) — always state each dose's date (or 'yesterday'/'today' relative to the requested date) when listing them, never assume every dose happened today. latest_safe_dose_time/cutoff_state answer ONLY whether a dose would clear circulation by bedtime — a completely separate question from the daily caffeine goal. Compare total_mg_for_date against daily_goal_mg before suggesting the user could take more today: if total_mg_for_date already meets or exceeds daily_goal_mg, say so and do not frame the cutoff time as an invitation for another dose that day, even though it would still clear by bedtime. daily_goal_mg is the user's caffeine goal for the date (the same value sparky_manage_goals returns). A user with no personal goals row still receives 400 — the default FDA daily ceiling — so treat 400 as a real ceiling, not as 'no goal'. daily_goal_mg is null only if the goal could not be loaded; then skip the budget comparison and still answer the bedtime question.",
