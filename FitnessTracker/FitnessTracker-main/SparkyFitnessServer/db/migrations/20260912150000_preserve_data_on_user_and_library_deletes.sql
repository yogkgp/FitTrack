-- Deleting a user failed outright, deleting a library item quietly destroyed
-- other people's diary history, and the audit trail was erased along with the
-- account it described. All three come from delete rules that no longer match
-- the schema they were written for.
--
-- Statement order matters: the entry -> library rules are relaxed first, so that
-- the cleanup further down can remove a stale food or exercise without taking
-- somebody's diary entries with it.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 1. A diary entry outlives the library item it was logged from.
--
-- 20250717190700_add_cascading_deletes.sql made food_entries and exercise_entries
-- cascade from foods/exercises. That was right at the time: an entry was a bare
-- pointer, so losing the library row left a diary line that could not say what
-- was eaten or how many calories it was.
--
-- 20251019013200_merged_schema_and_data.sql then added the snapshot columns
-- (food_name, brand_name, serving_size, the nutrition set, exercise_name,
-- calories_per_hour, ...) and backfilled them. From that point an entry stood on
-- its own, but the delete rule was never revisited -- so removing a food still
-- deleted every entry referencing it, including entries belonging to other users
-- who logged it through family sharing.
--
-- Blank the pointer and keep the entry. The diary read path already LEFT JOINs
-- foods/food_variants and reads fe.* for name and nutrition.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- chk_food_or_meal_id (20251023221501_add_meal_id_to_food_entries.sql) demands
-- exactly one of food_id/meal_id. Nulling food_id on a food-logged entry leaves
-- both null, so the check would reject the delete and the foreign key rule below
-- would never get to preserve anything. Relax it to what it is actually there to
-- prevent -- an entry claiming to be both a food and a meal -- and let an entry
-- whose library row is gone stand on its own snapshot.

-- administrator erased the record of everything they had ever done -- which is
-- the one question an audit log exists to answer.
--
-- Dissociate rather than delete. The acting and target ids are also copied into
-- `details` by the caller, so an entry stays readable once the accounts are gone.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- admin_user_id is NOT NULL today, which is what forced CASCADE on it. Allow
-- NULL so the event can outlive the administrator who performed it.
