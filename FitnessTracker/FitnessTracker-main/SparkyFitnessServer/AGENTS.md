# AGENTS.md

_Last updated: 2026-09-14_

SparkyFitness Server is the backend API package for the SparkyFitness monorepo. Use this file as the primary guide for work inside `SparkyFitnessServer/`.

**Quick Links for AI Tools:** See `../agent-docs/README.md` for:

- `file-and-domain-reference.md` — Where to find server code by feature
- `testing-patterns.md` — How to test routes, services, repositories, and RLS
- `architecture-permissions.md` — Permission types and RLS patterns
- `new-migration-checklist.md` — 8-step database change checklist

If a task also touches `shared/`, the frontend, or the mobile app, read the relevant package guide before editing outside this directory. Use `../AGENTS.md` for monorepo-level context.

## Scope

- This file is for package-local work in `SparkyFitnessServer/`.
- Keep changes inside this package unless the task clearly crosses package boundaries.
- This is the single source of truth for the package; `CLAUDE.md` just imports it via `See @AGENTS.md`.
- Do not invent alternate boot paths, duplicate route registries, or parallel migration flows when the current startup path already covers the behavior.

## Current Snapshot

- Dev boot path: `pnpm start` -> `nodemon` -> `tsx index.ts`
- `index.ts` loads `../.env`, applies file-backed secrets, runs preflight checks, applies migrations and RLS policies, then imports `SparkyFitnessServer.ts`
- Main app shell: `SparkyFitnessServer.ts`
- Stack: Express 5, PostgreSQL via `pg`, Better Auth, Zod, TypeScript 5, Vitest 4, ESLint 10
- Module system: ESM with `type: "module"` and `moduleResolution: "NodeNext"`
- The package is now effectively TypeScript-first; almost all source files are `.ts`
- Main domains: food and meal tracking, exercise logging, health and sleep data, sleep science, fasting, medications, mood, menstrual cycle and pregnancy, reporting, AI chat, onboarding, identity, admin tooling, and external provider integrations

## Verified Commands

```bash
pnpm start
pnpm run validate
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run lint
pnpm run lint:fix
pnpm run format:check
pnpm run format
pnpm test
pnpm run test:watch
pnpm run test:coverage
pnpm run test:ci
pnpm exec vitest run tests/mealRoutes.test.ts
pnpm exec eslint routes/v2/foodRoutes.ts services/foodCoreService.ts
```

- `pnpm start` uses hot reload through `nodemon`; `nodemon.json` ultimately executes `tsx index.ts`
- `pnpm run validate` runs typecheck, lint, and Prettier check together
- `pnpm test` runs `vitest run`
- The backend default port is `3010` unless `SPARKY_FITNESS_SERVER_PORT` overrides it
- For targeted test runs, prefer `pnpm exec vitest run tests/<name>.test.ts`

## Source Map

- `index.ts` - real dev entrypoint; loads env, secrets, and preflight checks before booting the app
- `SparkyFitnessServer.ts` - Express app shell, route mounting, Swagger/ReDoc, cron setup, graceful shutdown
- `auth.ts` - Better Auth configuration, plugins, session behavior, SSO provider syncing
- `routes/` - primary HTTP route surface
- `routes/v2/` - newer typed route surface; pair these changes with `schemas/`
- `routes/v2/openFoodFactsContributionRoutes.ts` - owner-only single-food preview and explicit photo-backed publication; background contributions are disabled for this release
- `routes/v2/reportRoutes.ts` - weekly alcohol rollup and the zero-padded hydration/caffeine/alcohol range used by the Trends charts (`reports` permission)
- `routes/v2/nutritionKineticsRoutes.ts` - active-caffeine estimate and bedtime cutoff (`diary` permission)
- `routes/auth/` - auth-specific route fragments mounted through `routes/authRoutes.ts`
- `services/` - business logic and orchestration
- `models/` - PostgreSQL repositories and persistence helpers
- `middleware/` - auth, permissions, uploads, and shared Express middleware
- `utils/uploadsPath.ts` - the uploads root plus the resolver and containment guard for stored `file_path` values; use it instead of re-deriving `SPARKY_FITNESS_CUSTOM_UPLOADS_DIRECTORY`
- `utils/oauthState.ts` - server-issued single-use OAuth `state` nonces for provider linking (`issueOAuthState`, `persistOAuthState`, `claimOAuthState`); use it instead of hand-rolling a state value
- `middleware/requireSelfMiddleware.ts` - `requireSelfActor`, which rejects a switched/delegated context outright; attach per-route to account-linking routes
- `integrations/` - provider adapters and ingest pipelines
- `schemas/` - Zod route schemas
- `types/` - TypeScript declarations, including `Express.Request` augmentation
- `db/` - pool management, grants, migrations, and RLS policies
- `config/` - logging and Swagger config
- `utils/` - startup helpers, CORS, permissions, timezone loading, OIDC helpers, migration helpers
- `ai/` - AI provider configuration (`config.ts`), the unified provider-dispatch helper (`providerDispatch.ts`), and the in-process chatbot tool registry (`ai/tools/`)
- `security/` - encryption utilities (`encryption.ts`)
- `validation/` - legacy express-validator rules for a few older routes (new routes use Zod schemas)
- `constants/` - shared constants and supporting package data
- `tests/` - Vitest suites plus a few utility scripts
- `devdocs/` - local notes and debugging artifacts when present

When searching, ignore noisy/generated directories unless you explicitly need them:

- `node_modules/`
- `coverage/`
- `uploads/`
- `temp_uploads/`
- `backup/`
- `mock_data/`

## Architecture

### Boot and App Shell

- `index.ts` is the true local boot path used by `pnpm start`; do not bypass it for normal development because it performs env loading and preflight work
- `SparkyFitnessServer.ts` creates the Express app, configures static upload serving, mounts auth interception, registers routes, exposes API docs, schedules cron jobs, and handles graceful shutdown
- Startup order matters:
  - `index.ts`: apply pending migrations, then reapply `db/rls_policies.sql` — **before** `SparkyFitnessServer.ts` (and therefore `auth.ts`) is imported
  - upsert env-configured OIDC provider
  - mount Better Auth
  - sync trusted SSO providers
  - register cron jobs
  - optionally promote `SPARKY_FITNESS_ADMIN_EMAIL` to admin
  - start listening
- Public API docs live at:
  - `/api/api-docs/swagger`
  - `/api/api-docs/redoc`
  - `/api/api-docs/json`
- If you change public endpoints, keep Swagger JSDoc and `config/swagger.ts` coverage accurate

### Environment and Secrets

- Runtime `.env` is expected at `../.env`
- The tracked template lives at `../docker/.env.example`
- `utils/secretLoader.ts` loads `*_FILE` secrets before preflight validation
- Current hard startup requirements enforced by `utils/preflightChecks.ts` include:
  - `SPARKY_FITNESS_DB_HOST`
  - `SPARKY_FITNESS_DB_NAME`
  - `SPARKY_FITNESS_DB_USER`
  - `SPARKY_FITNESS_DB_PASSWORD`
  - `SPARKY_FITNESS_APP_DB_USER`
  - `SPARKY_FITNESS_APP_DB_PASSWORD`
  - `SPARKY_FITNESS_FRONTEND_URL`
  - `SPARKY_FITNESS_API_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
- `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` is currently soft-required: startup will generate a temporary value if it is missing, but that is only appropriate for throwaway local runs because sessions will not survive restarts
- Common operational toggles include `SPARKY_FITNESS_SERVER_PORT`, `SPARKY_FITNESS_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `ALLOW_PRIVATE_NETWORK_CORS`, `ALLOW_PRIVATE_NETWORK_AI`, `ALLOW_PRIVATE_NETWORK_FOOD_PROVIDERS`, `SPARKY_FITNESS_EXTRA_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`, and `BETTER_AUTH_URL`
- User-configured self-hosted food providers (Mealie/Tandoor/Norish) can point `base_url` at a private/internal address only for admins by default; a non-admin on a multi-user server is blocked unless `ALLOW_PRIVATE_NETWORK_FOOD_PROVIDERS=true`. This mirrors the AI policy (a single-user self-host is an admin, so their LAN recipe server works with no config). Enforced by `utils/outboundUrlPolicy.ts` (`deriveFoodProviderNetworkPolicy(isAdmin)`) at provider save time in `services/externalProviderService.ts`. Separate from `ALLOW_PRIVATE_NETWORK_AI` by design
- `ALLOW_PRIVATE_NETWORK_AI=true` lets non-admin users use custom AI service URLs (`custom`/`ollama`/`openai_compatible`) that resolve to private/internal addresses; default off is an SSRF guard enforced by `utils/outboundUrlPolicy.ts` at save/test time and again in the runtime guarded fetch path. Current admins and global admin-created AI settings can use private URLs for self-hosted providers like Ollama

### TypeScript and Module Conventions

- This package is now almost entirely TypeScript; new source files should be `.ts`
- Keep local relative imports using `.js` extensions from TypeScript files, for example `import foo from './foo.js'`
- `eslint.config.js` enforces file extensions in imports
- `tsconfig.json` uses `NodeNext`, `noEmit`, and `allowJs: false`
- `@workspace/shared` resolves directly to `../shared/src/index.ts` here and in Vitest
- Avoid using `any` declarations in models, repositories, and integration services (e.g. `integrations/fatsecret/fatsecretService.ts`). Instead, use base datatypes (like `string`), proper types/interfaces, or import strict type schemas directly from `@workspace/shared`.
- New public endpoints should include TypeScript code, Zod validation, and automated tests

### Logging

- Use `log(level, message, ...args)` from `config/logging.ts`; levels are `'debug'`, `'info'`, `'warn'`, and `'error'`
- Never use `console.error` (or other `console.*`) in application code
- `SPARKY_FITNESS_LOG_LEVEL` controls verbosity (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, `SILENT`)

### Database and RLS

- Use `getClient(userId, authenticatedUserId?)` from `db/poolManager.ts` for normal user-scoped queries
- `getClient(...)` sets `public.set_app_context(...)`; that is what makes row-level security work correctly
- Use `getSystemClient()` only for admin, migration, startup, or policy-management work that intentionally bypasses RLS
- Always release database clients in a `finally` block
- To learn a table's current shape, read `../shared/src/schemas/database/<Table>.zod.ts` (one small Zod file per table) instead of reading `../db_schema_backup.sql` or reconstructing it from the 185 migration files
- New migrations belong in `db/migrations/` and must use `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_description.sql`
- **Never manually edit `../db_schema_backup.sql`** — after merge, CI regenerates it from the migrations and opens an automated sync PR (`.github/workflows/schema-backup.yml`). Do not commit copies generated from a local database.
- If you add a new table or change user-visible access behavior, follow `../agent-docs/new-migration-checklist.md`. In short, you MUST:
  1. Add/modify the RLS policies in `db/rls_policies.sql`.
  2. Update the user-facing documentation in `../docs/content/2.features/9.family-friends-sharing.md`.
  3. Update the developer-facing documentation in `../docs/content/8.developer/11.database-security-tiers.md` to define its security tier (Tier 1, Tier 2, or Tier 3).
  4. Add or update the matching Zod schema in `../shared/src/schemas/database/`.
- Startup automatically applies migrations and then reapplies RLS policies; do not create alternate migration mechanisms
- Migrations run from `index.ts`, **before any application module is imported**, and via dynamic `await import()`. Both details are load-bearing: Better Auth validates the schema eagerly at `auth.ts` module scope and caches a mismatch for the life of the process (issues #2469 / #2470), and `db/poolManager.ts` builds its pools at module load, so a static import would be hoisted above the env/secret loading. `tests/bootOrder.test.ts` guards this

### Uploads: Public vs Sensitive

- `SparkyFitnessServer.ts` serves the uploads root publicly at `/uploads` and `/api/uploads`; both are in `publicRoutes`, so `authenticate` never runs on them
- Sensitive subtrees are **denied on the static mount** and served instead by an authenticated, owner-checked per-id route. Two exist today:
  - `check-in` -> `GET /api/measurements/check-in-photos/file/:id` (delegatable via the `checkin` permission)
  - `pregnancy` -> `GET /api/v2/pregnancy/photos/file/:id` (owner-only; deliberately **no** `checkPermissionMiddleware`, because reproductive-health data is never delegated)
- Adding a sensitive upload subtree means adding its directory name to `SENSITIVE_UPLOAD_SUBTREES` in `SparkyFitnessServer.ts` **and** adding an authenticated file route; the deny rule matches the decoded, normalized path, because a prefix match on the raw URL is bypassable with `..%2f`
- Responses for these domains omit `file_path`: the on-disk layout is a server detail and clients address photos by id
- `tests/uploadsStaticMount.test.ts` guards both the deny behavior and the fact that the deny rule is registered before `express.static`

### Auth and Request Context

- Better Auth is configured in `auth.ts` and mounted under `/api/auth`
- `SparkyFitnessServer.ts` intercepts `/api/auth*` requests before the normal request logger and has special handling for discovery routes and sign-out cookie cleanup
- `middleware/authMiddleware.ts` populates:
  - `req.userId`
  - `req.authenticatedUserId`
  - `req.originalUserId`
  - `req.activeUserId`
  - `req.user`
- `req.userId` is the active RLS target; `req.authenticatedUserId` is the logged-in actor
- Family and delegated access flow through `middleware/checkPermissionMiddleware.ts`, `middleware/onBehalfOfMiddleware.ts`, and the auth middleware’s active-user switching
- `checkPermissionMiddleware(permissionType)` guards routes; permission types are `'diary'`, `'reports'`, and `'checkin'`
- If you change auth behavior, check both cookie-backed sessions and API key flows

### Dates, Day Strings, and Timezones

- Prefer the shared helpers exported by `@workspace/shared` for day-string and timezone-aware logic
- Common server-side helpers include `todayInZone`, `instantToDay`, `dayToUtcRange`, `dayRangeToUtcRange`, `localDateToDay`, `addDays`, `compareDays`, and `isDayString`
- Load the user timezone through `utils/timezoneLoader.ts` before deriving "today", bucketing events by day, or building date ranges from user context
- Treat `YYYY-MM-DD` values as calendar-day strings, not UTC-midnight timestamps
- Avoid `toISOString().split('T')[0]` for user-facing or business-logic dates; it silently shifts dates near timezone boundaries
- If you touch older code that still uses UTC split patterns, prefer migrating that path to the shared helpers instead of copying the pattern forward
- Timezone/date regression coverage already exists in:
  - `tests/timezone.test.ts`
  - `tests/dateShifting.test.ts`
  - `tests/measurementService.timezone.test.ts`

### Integrations and Background Work

- Provider-specific adapters live under `integrations/`; coordinating logic usually lives in `services/` and persistence in `models/`
- Current adapters span food/nutrition (OpenFoodFacts, FatSecret, Nutritionix, USDA, Mealie, Tandoor, Norish, SwissFood, Yazio), fitness devices (Garmin Connect sync plus FIT file import via `integrations/garminfit/` + `services/fitImportService.ts`, Withings, Fitbit, Oura, Polar, Strava, Hevy), exercise databases (Wger, FreeExerciseDB), and health-data import (Google Health, generic/mobile health data)
- Scheduled jobs currently include backups, session cleanup, and hourly sync loops for Withings, Garmin, Fitbit, Oura, Polar, and Strava
- Integration work often spans route, service, repository, cron, and external-provider settings code; inspect the whole path before calling the work complete
- **OAuth linking (`/authorize`, `/callback`) is self-only, and `state` is a server-issued single-use nonce.** Never derive a user id from a callback request body, and never gate an authorize route with `checkPermissionMiddleware('diary')` — on GET that resolves to `diary_read`, which would hand a read-only delegate the owner's decrypted OAuth client id. Use `requireSelfActor` plus `utils/oauthState.ts`. Withings and Polar follow this pattern; Oura, Fitbit and Strava are self-only but still send `state = userId` and ignore it on callback (tracked follow-up)

### AI Services

- AI calls go through the Vercel `ai` SDK (v6) with provider adapters for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google, plus OpenAI-compatible, Mistral, Groq, OpenRouter, and Ollama service types
- `ai/config.ts` holds default model and vision-model selection per provider; `ai/providerDispatch.ts` is the unified dispatch helper used by chat, food-photo analysis, nutrition-label scan, and unit conversion
- Prefer routing new AI features through `providerDispatch.ts` instead of calling provider SDKs directly
- Chatbot tool calls run in-process through the registry in `ai/tools/`
- `ai/tools/index.ts` exposes `buildChatbotTools(userId, tz)`, composing the per-domain builders (`build<Domain>Tools` in `ai/tools/<domain>Tools.ts`); handlers close over the authenticated user — so two-actor services receive `(userId, userId, ...)` — and the user's IANA timezone, used for "today" defaults and day bucketing
- Tool handlers follow a fixed contract: publish a flat Zod schema, validate with a strict union `safeParse` inside `execute`, orchestrate through existing services and repositories, and never throw - errors come back as `ERRORS.*` strings from `ai/tools/errors.ts`
- Tool output text is a parity contract with the MCP tool set; golden tests in `tests/chatbotTools*.test.ts` assert exact returned strings, so do not reword tool output casually

## Testing and Validation

- Test runner: Vitest, not Jest
- Auto-discovered test files match `tests/**/*.test.ts`
- `tests/check_routes.ts` and `tests/*.script.ts` are utility scripts, not normal test suites
- For route or contract work, targeted `supertest`-based Vitest tests are the normal validation path
- Prefer `pnpm run typecheck` after touching `routes/v2/`, `schemas/`, `types/`, or shared request/response contracts
- Prefer `pnpm run lint` after multi-file edits; if unrelated package-wide issues make that noisy, run targeted `pnpm exec eslint <paths>` on the touched files before stopping
- Use `pnpm run test:coverage` after broad service, route, repository, middleware, or auth refactors

## Quick Routing

- Startup, env, or deployment issue:
  inspect `index.ts`, `SparkyFitnessServer.ts`, `utils/secretLoader.ts`, `utils/preflightChecks.ts`, and `config/logging.ts`
- Auth, session, MFA, or API key issue:
  inspect `auth.ts`, `middleware/authMiddleware.ts`, `routes/authRoutes.ts`, and `routes/auth/`
- Migration, RLS, or permission issue:
  inspect `db/migrations/`, `db/rls_policies.sql`, `db/poolManager.ts`, `utils/applyRlsPolicies.ts`, and the permission middleware/helpers
- Public v2 contract issue:
  inspect the matching file in `routes/v2/` plus the related Zod schema in `schemas/`
- Food, barcode, or external provider issue:
  inspect the relevant `integrations/*` code, then the matching service and repository files
- Open Food Facts publication:
  inspect `services/openFoodFactsManualContributionService.ts`, `integrations/openfoodfacts/openFoodFactsContribution.ts`, and `constants/openFoodFacts.ts`; retained automatic queue code is dormant and needs a new migration before a future release can activate its triggers
- Health data or date bucketing issue:
  inspect `integrations/healthData/healthDataRoutes.ts`, `services/measurementService.ts`, and `utils/timezoneLoader.ts`
- Water, hydration, caffeine, or alcohol issue:
  inspect `services/hydrationTotalsService.ts` (the single owner of the daily water formula), `services/measurementService.ts` (the container "+/-" path and the container->food link), `services/caffeineKineticsService.ts` / `services/alcoholWeekService.ts`, `models/waterContainerRepository.ts`, and the shared maths in `../shared/src/nutrients/`
- Self-service "delete synced data by source" issue:
  inspect `routes/syncedDataRoutes.ts`, `services/syncedDataService.ts`, and `models/syncedDataRepository.ts` (the `SYNCED_SOURCE_TABLES` whitelist)
- AI chat or chatbot tool issue:
  inspect `services/chatService.ts`, `ai/tools/`, and the matching domain service and repository
- Fasting or mood issue:
  inspect `routes/fastingRoutes.ts` / `routes/moodRoutes.ts` and `models/fastingRepository.ts` / `models/moodRepository.ts`
- Medications, cycle, or pregnancy issue:
  inspect the matching v2 route (`routes/v2/medicationRoutes.ts`, `routes/v2/cycleRoutes.ts`, `routes/v2/pregnancyRoutes.ts`), its Zod schema in `schemas/`, then `services/cycleService.ts` / `services/pregnancyService.ts` and the `models/medication*Repository.ts` / `models/cycleRepository.ts` / `models/pregnancyRepository.ts` files
- Sleep or sleep-science issue:
  inspect `routes/sleepRoutes.ts`, `routes/sleepScienceRoutes.ts`, `services/sleepAnalyticsService.ts`, `services/sleepScienceService.ts`, and the sleep repositories

## Architecture Resources

Before adding a feature or changing auth/permission behavior, read:

- `../docs/content/8.developer/4.database.md` — Quick table index (all ~120 tables with purpose) + migration best practices
- `../docs/content/8.developer/11.database-security-tiers.md` — Security tier, permission type, and RLS rules for every table (authoritative)
- `../agent-docs/architecture-permissions.md` — Permission types, links to tier classification doc
- `../agent-docs/data-flow-patterns.md` — Data flow from frontend through server to database, safe RLS patterns
- `../agent-docs/new-domain-template.md` — Checklist for adding a major feature domain
- `../agent-docs/anti-patterns.md` — Common mistakes (using getSystemClient(), forgetting RLS, cache invalidation, timezone bugs, cross-package contract mismatches)

## Working Rules

- Match the existing service/repository/middleware layering instead of introducing parallel abstractions
- **Library Deletes vs Diary Snapshots:** `exercise_entries` and `food_entries` are snapshot-backed (`exercise_id` / `food_id` are `ON DELETE SET NULL`). `deleteExercise` and `deleteFood` (`mode: 'delete'`) must never delete past or today's diary entries; they cascade from templates/presets, clean up future scheduled plan entries (`entry_date >= today AND workout_plan_assignment_id IS NOT NULL`), and clean up empty parent preset entries. Only explicit `delete_with_history` (force delete) deletes diary entries for that user. If an item is referenced by others (`otherUserReferences > 0`), the delete must fall back to `hide` (`is_quick_exercise` / `is_quick_food`).
- If your change adds a new domain, route family, or table, update this file's Snapshot, Source Map, and Quick Routing sections (and the `Last updated` date) in the same change
- If you add persisted or user-visible data, think through migration, RLS, permissions, tests, API docs, and downstream client contracts together
- Validate shared-contract changes from the affected consumers, not just from this package
- Keep package-specific guidance here; use `../AGENTS.md` only for cross-package context

## File Naming Conventions

- Routes: `*Routes.ts` (e.g., `foodEntryRoutes.ts`)
- Services: `*Service.ts` (e.g., `foodEntryService.ts`)
- Repositories: `*Repository.ts` (e.g., `foodRepository.ts`, `mealRepository.ts`)
- Some domain model files predate the Repository suffix and remain without it (e.g., `food.ts`, `foodEntry.ts`, `exercise.ts`)

## Planning

- Before presenting a plan for server work, self-review it against `../agent-docs/plan-review-checklist.md` and fix any gaps first.

## Priority Rule

- For work inside `SparkyFitnessServer/`, this file wins over repo-root guidance on package-specific details
- Use `../AGENTS.md` for monorepo context
- If a task spans multiple packages, combine this guide with the other affected package guides instead of relying on one file alone
