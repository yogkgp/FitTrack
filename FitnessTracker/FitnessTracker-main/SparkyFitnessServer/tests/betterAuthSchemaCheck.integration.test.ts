/**
 * Better Auth ↔ Database Schema Check
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * Better Auth validates, at startup, that the database can hold everything it
 * writes. A Better Auth upgrade that adds columns (as 1.5 -> 1.7 did: the
 * two-factor lockout fields, SSO `saml_config`/`user_id`/`organization_id`,
 * `session.impersonated_by`) silently breaks every `/api/auth/*` request until
 * a matching migration lands — the mismatch is cached for the life of the
 * process, so the server starts and then fails every auth request.
 *
 * That shipped once (issues #2469 / #2470). This test makes the next one fail
 * in CI instead: against a fully migrated database, the real auth
 * configuration's own schema check must come back clean.
 *
 * If this fails after a Better Auth upgrade, the fix is a migration adding the
 * reported columns (plus the matching field mapping in auth.ts), following
 * agent-docs/new-migration-checklist.md.
